## 🧠 How It Works

```
User fills title + details  →  clicks "Add Note"
        ↓
submitHandler() fires  →  spreads existing task array
        ↓
pushes { title, details }  →  setTask() updates state
        ↓
React re-renders  →  new card appears in the grid

User clicks 🗑️  →  deleteNote(idx) fires
        ↓
splice(idx, 1) removes item  →  setTask() updates state
        ↓
React re-renders  →  card removed instantly
```

---

## 🎨 UI Highlights

- **Dark gradient background** — `from-gray-950 via-gray-900`
- **Glassmorphism form card** — `bg-gray-800/60` with `backdrop-blur`
- **Blue focus rings** on inputs for accessibility
- **Red trash icon button** with hover fill and active scale effect
- **Auto-height note cards** — content never overflows or gets clipped
